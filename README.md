# raspi-fdtech-rockyborg
This was a private project for a scholarship in the company and therefore has no valuable commit messages.  
It was there to control a [Rockyborg](https://github.com/piborg/RockyBorg). You could take a picture of an object, place it somewhere and the robot tried to find it, based on its color.
